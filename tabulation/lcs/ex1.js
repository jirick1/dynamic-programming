// Longest Common Subsequence Problem

/**
 * 
 * The Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem is finding the longest 
 * subsequence present in given two sequences in the same order, i.e.,
 *  find the longest sequence which can be obtained from the first original 
 * sequence by deleting some items and from the second original sequence by deleting other items.

// The length of the LCS is 4
// LCS are BDAB, BCAB, and BCBA
